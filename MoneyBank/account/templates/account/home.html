                <p>Gold may witness choppy trade as US dollar counters signs of recovery against Fedâ€™s dovish stance
                    however we expect to see buying interest in gold at lower levels amid persisting risks to global
                    economy and hopes of continuing stimulus measures.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">august 23, 2020</p>

                <p>The market continued its winning streak for the third consecutive month in August majorly on the back
                    of FII money. The rising hope for economic recovery and strong earnings in FY22, and progress on the
                    vaccine front along with increasing recovery rate in COVID-19 cases boosted the sentiment.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The BSE Sensex climbed 2.72 percent in the month gone by, though gains were capped due to
                        sell-off on the last day of the month amid reports of India-China border tensions. The monthly
                        gains were lower than July and June when market posted 7.7 percent rally each.

                    Auto (up 7 percent), Banks (9.65 percent), Capital Goods (7.9 percent) and Metal (up 12.88
                    percent) were leading sectors in a rally. However, FMCG and IT were laggards.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">August 14, 2020</p>

                <p>The Indian rupee has opened lower at 73.05 against the US dollar on September 2, falling 19 paise
                    following an increase in the greenback.</p>
                <p>The currency closed at 72.86 a dollar in previous session, gaining a percent, which was the biggest
                    single session gain since December 18, 2018.</p>
                <p>But analysts feel any upside in dollar is short-term, in fact the dollar index may weaken further
                    amid US political uncertainty.

                    "US political uncertainty ahead of November's presidential election and concerns about US economic
                    recovery are likely to further weaken the greenback," ICICI Direct said.

                    Meanwhile, the equity market was marginally under pressure amid volatility. The Nifty50 was down 24
                    points at 11,446.30 and the BSE Sensex fell 117.95 points to 38,782.85 at the time of writing this
                    article.

                    Foreign institutional investors were net buyers to the tune of Rs 486.09 crore on September 1,
                    whereas DIIs net sold Rs 775.23 crore in same session.</p>
